\section*{Executive Summary}
In today's day and age, engineers are expected to be versatile in more aspects than ever
before. One of these is project management. This assignment hopes to introduce and
ready engineering students for project management and as close to reality as possible. For
example, the teams of students are multi-disciplinary, and had most probably not had prior
experience working together. For this particular assignment, a project structure has been designed in order to manage the creation of a beer brewery.\\

\noindent
Throughout this document the team will be working to create the product in a 11 month period with a budget of \$380 000. The students need to use these restrictions and plan how they will use the resources to complete the project. The resources will be bid on by using a simulation program called Sim4Projects. Using this program, the students have to bid against other teams to create a real life simulation. To bid on these resources they need to determine how much they are willing to spend on the different resources and how much they will be willing to spend on training these resources. By creating a budget that corresponds with the baseline plan they can determine how they can manage the resources.\\

\noindent
To manage the resources, the team needs to identify the objectives of the project as part of the project scope. If the objectives are determined they can then create deliverables so that he project stays on track and on budget. Milestones are put together and the critical tasks will be identified. The milestones also help insure that the project will stay within the time frame. A work breakdown structure will also be structured to help insure that project will stay on schedule. By doing this the work can then be divided between the different engineers to ensure the skills of all the engineers are used optimally. Project requirements, limitations and exclusions must be identified so that it is clear what is possible and what is not possible during the process of creating the brewery. The last part of the project scope is to review and approve all the decisions made so that the process of creating the project can begin.
\\

\noindent
Using Microsoft Project, the students can create a baseline plan that will give a visual aid to determine if the project is on track with the estimated times. By putting more people on certain project they can then reduce the time that the project will and ensure that the project will be finished within the set time frame. Using this baseline, they can then setup an estimated budget.\\

\noindent
The budget that is created is setup for a perfect scenario were everything runs smoothly and without any interruptions. In real life this will not always be the situation. In some circumstances there will be risks involved that may change the timeline and the budget of the project. The team need to be prepared for these situations. Risks need to be identified and analysed. A Risk Assessment Plan is set up to evaluate the risk and how these risks will be managed.

\subsection{Work Responsibilities of disciplinary}

\textbf{Sarel Swart – Process Engineer}\\
\noindent
It will be the work of the process engineer to develop the process that needs to be followed from start to finish of the beer brewery production. This engineer will identify the different ingredients that will have to be added and processes during the development of this product. The engineer will identify the different stages of the process such as malting, mashing and fermentation process.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Biancé Huysamen – Civil Engineer}\\
\noindent
The engineer will have the responsibility of designing the factory/ building of the brewery. A finished building will be renovated and adapted to fit the purpose of a brewery. It is also necessary to use natural lighting and environmentally friendly materials for the building in the most cost efficient way. Civil engineers are also skilled in communicating with different parties. Huysamen also exhibits good financial qualities and will therefore be responsible for the setting up the budget.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Daniel Robinson \& Eduard van der Merwe – Electrical Engineers}\\
\noindent
The brewery will be controlled by electronic systems that have to be developed and programmed. It will be the responsibility of the engineer to update this and ensure the working of the different machinery of the processes and assist will all the programming of the project. Electrical engineers also are focused on detail and therefore Robinson will act as the Quality engineer whilst van der Merwe will assist with the risk analysis.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Carmen Steyn – Industrial Engineer}\\
\noindent
The engineer will ensure that the whole project will run smoothly and will have a broad overview of the project. Industrial engineers are skilled in optimizing systems. The engineer will help with the efficiency of the production process. It’s important that a logical process is developed and designed. The engineer will also oversee the administrative and financial aspects of the project, since industrial engineers are exposed to the business aspects. Steyn will therefore also focus on Marketing and Commercialization.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Peter Toulouras – Mechanical Engineer}\\
\noindent
Toulouras will be responsible for the designing of the different machinery, pumps and tanks that will be used in the brewery process. Toulouras also exhibits great leadership, communication and delegation skills and therefore will fulfill the position of Project leader. It is the responsibility of the project leader to ensure that deadlines are met, that the clients are happy and that the project stays within budget and timeline. Therefore Toulouse will assist with running the entire project.


\subsection{Technical Requirements}
\subsubsection{Summary of product}

There are four types of beer that need to be manufactured namely: Weiss, Ale and two different flavoured lagers. All the beers utilize the same brewing system with slight alterations needed to create each unique beer. These alterations include different fermenting processes and different grains used. There needs to be four brewing systems working simultaneously in order to produce a sufficient amount of all beers. 

\subsubsection{Product Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item There should be 4 varieties of beer
\item Each beer will be sold in 500ml glasses
\item The temperature of the beer should always be carefully monitored from the brewing process until the product is sold to the customer 
\item Control systems should be put in place in order to monitor and control each stage of the brewing process 
\item The quality of the final product needs to be of a high standard in order to compete in the respective market 
\item The  final product should be marked at a reasonable price in order to appeal to a wider target market (students)
\item The process compromises of 12 stages that need to be carefully executed in order to produce the best possible product 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Project Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item Project commences $15^{th}$ February 2017 and terminates $31^{st}$ January 2018.
\item All the suppliers of the company should be identified and have their capabilities assessed 
\item The final product must be designed completely. The components should include specifications, risk analysis, design analysis, production process and possible testing requirements.
\item A full quality assessment must be done throughout all stages of production of the final product
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Limitations}

Limitations are either external or internal constraints placed on the project. In this project the limitations will be:
\begin{itemize}
\item	Cost – the project must be completed within the budget of \$380 000.
\item	Time – the project must be completed within the given time frame.
\item	Availability of required equipment and ingredients for the brewing process.
\item	Workforce/employees that will not work as efficiently as they possibly can.
\item	Unavailability of resources due to unforeseen circumstances.
\item	Construction limitations due to equipment being produced offsite – Difficulties in its transportation.
\item	Waiting Period to ensure a valid liquor licence from the National Liquor Authority which is a regulatory body within the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) responsible for administering The National Liquor Act
\item	Workforce rights – influence on production and employment costs
\item	Environmental responsibility - The entire project must have a minimal effect on the environment.
\item	Specific standards and regulations – The overall project must adhere to all relevant standards and regulations to ensure legal rights.
\item	Size of the building itself – Since it is a small local brewing company, the company only caters for a limited number of people. This means that there are limited staff members.
\item	Can only have a limited number of vats that fit inside the building. This means that only a limited amount of beer will be processed at a time, which leads to not being able to supply large quantities of beer at a time.
\item	Beer brewing takes time – One cannot produce beverages out of a vat too early.
\item	Construction/building takes time – one needs enough capital for delays.
\item	Marketing – Needs to be well marketed to ensure that the company makes a profit.
\item	Health and safety regulations – Needs a fire exit and all the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of everyone in and around the building.
\item	Limited parking space – Needs enough parking for at least 30\% of the customers at all times.
\item	Enough restrooms will be needed – Takes up space but it is crucial – could lead to unhappy staff that has to clean up after messy students.
\item	Competition – The price and the taste of the beer have to be on par or better than its rival companies.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Exclusions}
These are often referred to as the project boundaries. Exclusions are components of the system in which the project is completed that will not be addressed by the project. These will include\\
\begin{itemize}
\item	Maintenance, upgrading and operation of the brewing process.
\item	The availability of supporting infrastructure at the construction site (water pipes, power lines, access roads etc.)
\item	The project does not invest in broadening the variety of beers made.
\item	Municipal approval and authorization on project operations.
\item	Damage or theft of customer’s belongings – Everything is at their own risk.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Review and Approval} 

When developing a product or service for a client it is very important to keep client satisfaction in mind. If the client is not happy then there the feasibility of the project in general is compromised. If the project is not feasible there is market for the product or service because the customers will not buy it. This is why it is very important to do a feasibility study early on in the process. The feasibility study must ensure that the customer will be willing to spend money on this product or service. To determine if the product will be feasible the customer must evaluate the following; cost, the benefits of the project, the likelihood that the project will succeed and the reputation of the contractor that is used for the project.\\

\noindent
To be able to do a feasibility study all of the phases in the process need to be documented. These documents need to contain diagrams and schematic representations of the entire process and all the steps and resources that were used. By documenting everything it is easier for the customer to review all of the decisions made. It can also make it easier to see why these decisions were made. By making it easier for the customer to review the projects progress the contractor can be ensured of customer satisfaction. Customer approval procedure must be done regularly throughout the process, this ensures that if there are any errors early on in the process, they can be evaluated and alternative solutions can be made. By doing this regularly the contractor can ensure that the client stays satisfied throughout the process. If these errors are picked up early it can save the contractor a lot of money later in the process.

\section{Project Baseline Plan}
\subsection{Baseline Commentary}

A baseline following almost 40\% quicker estimates compared to the original simulation estimates, seems to correlate well with the simulated runs. However, some slack is required for a successful project. At least two weeks are given as leeway. Although the project is run tightly, it is justified due to the competitive nature of the project.\\

\noindent
See Appendix \ref{appendix:baseline} for the project baseline.

\section{Project Budget}

The estimated budget and estimated hours provided by Sim4project was used as a guideline of what should be spent during each period to ensure that the project would stay within the budget of \$380 000.\\

\noindent
To calculate the budget the effectiveness of the resources were brought into consideration. An assumption was made that all resources will work at an 80\% effectiveness rate. The estimated hours of each task as well as the safety margin of 80\% effectiveness was used to determine the hours worked for each task using the formula provided.


\begin{center}
$ Actual\ time\ worked\ (hours)\ =\ \frac{Estimated\ time\ (hours)}{\% effectiveness} $
\end{center}

\noindent
The budget forecast is provided in Appendix \ref{appendix:budget}.

\subsection{Direct Resource Costs}

Table \ref{tab:resourcecosts} provides the estimated cost of the different resources that will be hired. More than one engineer will be hired since the engineer will be working as a Project Manager for the period.

\subsection{Training and Events prospective costs}

There was decided that during the first period the engineer will be sent for training on project Management. This is to ensure that the engineer will be more effective as a project Manager. There was also decided to hire resources that are cheaper but have less skills and send them for training to improve their skills and effectiveness.\\

\noindent
Managerial actions will also be rewarded to resources to improve their work ethic and effictiveness.\\

\noindent
Table \ref{tab:actions} provides information regarding the different training and managerial actions that will take place during the provided timeline.

\section{Risk Analysis}

All risks pertaining to the simulator and product were identified and evaluated from project analogy. These risks were classified as internal or external based on the risk source, with 25 risk identified for each category. These risks were compiled and analysed in a special risk management meeting wherein the risks were identified and allocated to two group members to analyse in further detail. The minutes of the meeting may be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:minutes}.\\

\noindent
A comprehensive summary of the project risk may be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:projectrisks}. The risk rank, management strategy, and frequency are shown for each risk identified. The risk management strategy are classified as risk acceptance, risk control, risk avoidance, and contingency plan. This includes a more detailed summary of the risk response for each risk.\\

\noindent
The risk matrix is as follows, in Table \ref{tab:riskmatrix}.

% \subsection{How to add Tables}

% Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. 

% \begin{table}
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{l|r}
% Item & Quantity \\\hline
% Widgets & 42 \\
% Gadgets & 13
% \end{tabular}
% \caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
% \end{table}

% \subsection{How to write Mathematics}

% \LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
% \[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
%       = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
% denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.


% \subsection{How to create Sections and Subsections}

% Use section and subsections to organize your document. Simply use the section and subsection buttons in the toolbar to create them, and we'll handle all the formatting and numbering automatically.

% \subsection{How to add Lists}

% You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Like this,
% \item and like this.
% \end{enumerate}
% \dots or bullet points \dots
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Like this,
% \item and like this.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

% You can upload a \verb|.bib| file containing your BibTeX entries, created with JabRef; or import your \href{https://www.overleaf.com/blog/184}{Mendeley}, CiteULike or Zotero library as a \verb|.bib| file. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{greenwade93}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

% You can find a \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}{video tutorial here} to learn more about BibTeX.

% We hope you find Overleaf useful, and please let us know if you have any feedback using the help menu above --- or use the contact form at \url{https://www.overleaf.com/contact}!
