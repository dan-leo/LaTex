\section*{Executive Summary}
In today's day and age, engineers are expected to be versatile in more aspects than ever before. One of these is project management. This assignment hopes to introduce and ready engineering students for project management and as close to reality as possible. For example, the teams of students are multi-disciplinary, and had most probably not had prior experience working together.\\

\noindent
For this particular assignment, a project structure / 'blueprint' has been designed in order to manage the creation of a beer brewery.

\subsection{Technical Requirements}
\subsubsection{Summary of product}

There are four types of beer that need to be manufactured namely: Weiss, Ale and two different flavoured lagers. All the beers utilize the same brewing system with slight alterations needed to create each unique beer. These alterations include different fermenting processes and different grains used. There needs to be four brewing systems working simultaneously in order to produce a sufficient amount of all beers.

\subsubsection{Product Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item There should be 4 varieties of beer
\item Each beer will be sold in 500ml glasses
\item The temperature of the beer should always be carefully monitored from the brewing process until the product is sold to the customer 
\item Control systems should be put in place in order to monitor and control each stage of the brewing process 
\item The quality of the final product needs to be of a high standard in order to compete in the respective market 
\item The  final product should be marked at a reasonable price in order to appeal to a wider target market (students)
\item The process compromises of 12 stages that need to be carefully executed in order to produce the best possible product 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Project Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item Project commences 20th February 2017 and terminates 3rd May 2017
\item All the suppliers of the company should be identified and have their capabilities assessed 
\item The final product must be designed completely. The components should include specifications, risk analysis, design analysis, production process and possible testing requirements.
\item A full quality assessment must be done throughout all stages of production of the final product
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limits and Exclusions}

\subsubsection{Exclusions}
\subsection{Review and Approval} 

When developing a product or service for a client it is very important to keep client satisfaction in mind. If the client is not happy then there the feasibility of the project in general is compromised. If the project is not feasible there is market for the product or service because the customers will not buy it. This is why it is very important to do a feasibility study early on in the process. The feasibility study must ensure that the customer will be willing to spend money on this product or service. To determine if the product will be feasible the customer must evaluate the following; cost, the benefits of the project, the likelihood that the project will succeed and the reputation of the contractor that is used for the project.\\

\noindent
To be able to do a feasibility study all of the phases in the process need to be documented. These documents need to contain diagrams and schematic representations of the entire process and all the steps and resources that were used. By documenting everything it is easier for the customer to review all of the decisions made. It can also make it easier to see why these decisions were made. By making it easier for the customer to review the projects progress the contractor can be ensured of customer satisfaction. Customer approval procedure must be done regularly throughout the process, this ensures that if there are any errors early on in the process, they can be evaluated and alternative solutions can be made. By doing this regularly the contractor can ensure that the client stays satisfied throughout the process. If these errors are picked up early it can save the contractor a lot of money later in the process.

\section{Project Baseline Plan}
\subsection{Baseline Commentary}

\section{Project Budget}

The estimated budget and estimated hours provided by Sim4 project was used as a guideline of what should be spent during each period to ensure that the project would stay within the budget of \$380 000.\\

\noindent
To calculate the budget the effectiveness of the resources were brought into consideration. An assumption was made that all resources will work at an 80\% effectiveness rate. The estimated hours of each task as well as the safety margin of 80\% effectiveness was used to determine the hours worked for each task using the formula provided.\\

\begin{center}
$ Actual\ time\ worked\ (hours)\ =\ \frac{Estimated\ time\ (hours)}{\% effectiveness} $
\end{center}

The budget forecast is provided in Appendix \ref{appendix:budget}.

\subsection{Direct Resource Costs}

Table \ref{tab:resourcecosts} provides the estimated cost of the different resources that will be hired. More than one engineer will be hired since the engineer will be working as a Project Manager for the period.

\begin{table}[]

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Resources}          & \textbf{Rate} \\\hline
Engineer 1                  & \$58.00       \\
Engineer 2                  & \$42.00       \\
Junior Marketing Specialist & \$57.00       \\

Operation Specialist        & \$53.00       \\
Quality Engineer            & \$71.00       \\
Senior product designer     & \$84.00       \\
Engineer 3                  & \$55.00      
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Training and Events prospective costs}

There was decided that during the first period the engineer will be sent for training on project Management. This is to ensure that the engineer will be more effective as a project Manager. There was also decided to hire resources that are cheaper but have less skills and send them for training to improve their skills and effectiveness.\\

\noindent
Managerial actions will also be rewarded to resources to improve their work ethic and effictiveness.\\

\noindent
Table \ref{tab:actions} provides information regarding the different training and managerial actions that will take place during the provided timeline.

% \subsection{How to add Tables}

% Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. 

% \begin{table}
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{l|r}
% Item & Quantity \\\hline
% Widgets & 42 \\
% Gadgets & 13
% \end{tabular}
% \caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
% \end{table}

% \subsection{How to write Mathematics}

% \LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
% \[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
%       = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
% denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.


% \subsection{How to create Sections and Subsections}

% Use section and subsections to organize your document. Simply use the section and subsection buttons in the toolbar to create them, and we'll handle all the formatting and numbering automatically.

% \subsection{How to add Lists}

% You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Like this,
% \item and like this.
% \end{enumerate}
% \dots or bullet points \dots
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Like this,
% \item and like this.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

% You can upload a \verb|.bib| file containing your BibTeX entries, created with JabRef; or import your \href{https://www.overleaf.com/blog/184}{Mendeley}, CiteULike or Zotero library as a \verb|.bib| file. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{greenwade93}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

% You can find a \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}{video tutorial here} to learn more about BibTeX.

% We hope you find Overleaf useful, and please let us know if you have any feedback using the help menu above --- or use the contact form at \url{https://www.overleaf.com/contact}!
