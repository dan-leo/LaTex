\section*{Plagiarism Declaration}

I know that plagiarism is wrong.\\\\
\noindent
Plagiarism is to use another's work (even if it is summarised, translated or rephrased) and pretend that it is one's own. This assignment is our own work.\\\\
\noindent
Each contribution to and quotation (e.g. "cut and paste") in this assignment from the work(s) of other people has been explicitly attributed, and has been cited and referenced. In addition to being explicitly attributed, all quotations are enclosed in inverted commas, and long quotations are additionally in indented paragraphs.\\\\
\noindent
I have not allowed, and will not allow, anyone to use my work (in paper, graphics, electronic, verbal or any other format) with the intention of passing it off as his/her own work.\\\\
\noindent
I know that a mark of zero may be awarded to assignments with plagiarism and also that no opportunity be given to submit an improved assignment.\\\\
\noindent
I know that students involved in plagiarism will be reported to the Registrar and/or the Central Disciplinary Committee.

\section*{Executive Summary}
In today's day and age, engineers are expected to be versatile in more aspects than ever before. One of these is project management. This assignment hopes to introduce and ready engineering students for project management and as close to reality as possible. For example, the teams of students are multi-disciplinary, and had most probably not had prior experience working together.\\

\noindent
For this particular assignment, a project structure / 'blueprint' has been designed in order to manage the creation of a beer brewery.

\section{Systems Overview}

In this section the mission objectives and requirements are specified.

\subsection{Mission Objectives}
In order to be deemed successful the CanSat system needs to complete the following missions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The CanSat will be launched from approximately 1000m by a rocket.  The CanSat will then be ejected from the rocket.
    \item Measurements of air pressure and temperature will be taken during decent.
    \item These measurements will be transmitted at least once every second to the ground station.
    \item On the ground station the received data will be analysed.
\end{itemize}

% In order for the data to be transmitted successfully, it needs to be in a format acceptable by the GCS. The data will be stored in a JSON packet created using a C++ library\cite{ajson}.

% Code block \ref{code:json1} shows a potential data packet.

% \end{figure}




% \subsection{How to add Tables}

% Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. 

% \begin{table}
% \centering
% \begin{tabular}{l|r}
% Item & Quantity \\\hline
% Widgets & 42 \\
% Gadgets & 13
% \end{tabular}
% \caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
% \end{table}

% \subsection{How to write Mathematics}

% \LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
% \[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
%       = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
% denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.


% \subsection{How to create Sections and Subsections}

% Use section and subsections to organize your document. Simply use the section and subsection buttons in the toolbar to create them, and we'll handle all the formatting and numbering automatically.

% \subsection{How to add Lists}

% You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Like this,
% \item and like this.
% \end{enumerate}
% \dots or bullet points \dots
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Like this,
% \item and like this.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

% You can upload a \verb|.bib| file containing your BibTeX entries, created with JabRef; or import your \href{https://www.overleaf.com/blog/184}{Mendeley}, CiteULike or Zotero library as a \verb|.bib| file. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{greenwade93}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

% You can find a \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}{video tutorial here} to learn more about BibTeX.

% We hope you find Overleaf useful, and please let us know if you have any feedback using the help menu above --- or use the contact form at \url{https://www.overleaf.com/contact}!
